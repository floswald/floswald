### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an Assistant Professor of Economics @ScPoEcon in Paris. On my github profile you will find a large part of my work, related to both teaching and research. 

* I am working increasingly with @julialang only
* I have a lot of code in R, particularly spatial stuff
* I am a huge fan of github for teaching, so basically all my material is distributed via a repo

Drop me a line to say hello  ðŸ‘‹! Or bonjour or Hallo ðŸ˜„
