### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Turin (on leave from @ScPoEcon Paris). I'm also the Data Editor of the Economic Journal and the Econometrics Journal. You can find some related materials to this position on the [github org](https://github.com/RES-reproducibility) created for this purpose. On my personal github profile you will find a large part of my work, related to both teaching and research. 

* I am working increasingly with @julialang only
* I have a lot of code in R, particularly spatial stuff
* I am a huge fan of github for teaching, so basically all my material is distributed via a repo

Drop me a line to say hello
